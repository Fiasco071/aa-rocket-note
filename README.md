## Coins
Coins follows the same system and logic as a like, except you can give as many as you want (up to a maximum of 50). You can't give any coins to yourself in a story or comment though !
   - Add a coin to story
   Give a ton of coins to stories you think deserves them ! 
   Not only does the story keep track of how many coins you give, it keeps track of how many coins each user gives, dynamically updating and fetching the count for each story.
   - Add a coin to comments 
   Not only does the story keep track of how many coins you give, it keeps track of how many coins each user gives, dynamically updating and fetching the count for each comment.

## Conclusion
Input was an amazing collaborative effort to make. Not only did we love the theme, we got along great, put in a ton of work into something we really enjoyed making and it shows !
